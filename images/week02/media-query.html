      <h2> Matthew 7:7-11</h2>
      <p>7 Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:
      
      8 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
      
      9 Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?
      
      10 Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?
      
      11 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in
      heaven give good things to them that ask him?</p>

      <h2>Genesis 32:26-30</h2>
      <p>26 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.
      
      27 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.
      
      28 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with
      men, and hast prevailed.
      
      29 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after
      my name? And he blessed him there.
      
      30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.</p>
